# Teams

Employees at Made Tech are able to view which deliveries are currently running as well as the team members for their particular work stream. 

[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) is used for the frontend. Data from [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is presented in [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about). Acting as the backend database, Google Sheets allows the Operations team to use this effectively while reducing time for onboarding.
